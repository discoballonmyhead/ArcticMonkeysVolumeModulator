# Arctic Monkeys inspired Volume Modulator

This project is a web-based volume modulator that visualizes mathematical graphs with dynamic audio playback. Users can interact with the graph to adjust the volume and mute/unmute the audio. The project features a side menu for selecting different graphs, uploading music, and connecting to Spotify (placeholder).

## Features

- **Graph Visualization**: Displays a mathematical graph that dynamically changes with audio playback.
- **Volume Control**: Adjusts the audio volume based on user interaction with the graph.
- **Mute/Unmute**: Toggles the audio mute state by clicking on the graph.
- **Looping Functionality**: Loops the graph animation when audio is playing. The loop speed can be adjusted in the code.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is mobile-friendly and responsive.
- **Side Menu**: Provides options to select different graphs, upload music, and connect to Spotify.
